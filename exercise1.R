# 1.1 Simple addition and subtraction

10 + 5
10 - 5

# 1.2 An asterisk is used for multiplication

10*1576

# 1.3 A forward slash is used for division

15760/10

# 1.4 R has some values that are preset.

10+pi

10/pi

# 1.5 R uses the carat (Ë†) for exponents

10^2

#1.6 R uses the less than symbol followed by the hyphen as an assignment operator. (The two symbols form an icon that looks like a left facing arrow.) R uses the # symbol for comments; anything you enter after a # will be ignored by the R processor.

x <- 10
x - 3

#1.7 Beware of how R implements order in complex mathematical operations. The following expression correctly evaluates to 12. Can you explain why?

x <- 10
x - 3 + 10 / 2

#1.8 If x <- 10 and x - 3 + 10 / 2 = 12 How would you rewrite the expression to = 8.5?

x <- 10
x - 3 + 3 / 2

#1.9 R has some built-in mathematical functions:

sqrt(12)
abs(-23)
round(pi)

#1.10 R can easily create sequences of numbers:

1:10
12:37
