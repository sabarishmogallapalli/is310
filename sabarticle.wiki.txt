<!-- DEFINITIONS -->
'''Artificial intelligence''' ('''AI''') is the intelligence of [[machine]]s or [[software]], as opposed to the intelligence of humans or other animals. It is a [[field of study]] in [[computer science]] that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.

[[Applications of artificial intelligence|AI technology]] is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced [[web search engine]]s (e.g., [[Google Search]]), [[recommender system|recommendation systems]] (used by [[YouTube]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], and [[Netflix]]), [[natural-language understanding|understanding human speech]] (such as [[Google Assistant]], [[Siri]], and [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]]), [[self-driving car]]s (e.g., [[Waymo]]), [[Generative artificial intelligence|generative]] and [[Computational creativity|creative]] tools ([[ChatGPT]] and [[AI art]]), and superhuman play and analysis in [[strategy game]]s (such as [[chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]]).{{sfnp|Google|2016}}

<!-- SUMMARIZING HISTORY -->
Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence.<ref name="turing"/> Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.<ref name="Dartmouth workshop"/> The field went through multiple cycles of optimism<ref name="AI in the 60s"/><ref name="AI in the 80s"/> followed by disappointment and loss of funding.<ref name="First AI winter" /><ref name="Second AI winter"/> Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when [[deep learning]] surpassed all previous AI techniques,<ref name="Deep learning revolution"/> and after 2017 with the [[Transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]] architecture.{{sfnp|Toews|2023}} This led to the [[AI spring]] of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.{{sfnp|Frank|2023}}

<!-- SUMMARIZING GOALS AND TOOLS: SCOPE OF AI  -->
The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include [[automated reasoning|reasoning]], [[knowledge representation]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning]], [[machine learning|learning]], [[natural language processing]], [[machine perception|perception]], and support for [[robotics]].{{efn|name="Problems of AI"}} [[Artificial general intelligence|General intelligence]] (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.<ref name="AGI"/>

To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including [[state space search|search]] and [[mathematical optimization]], formal logic, [[artificial neural network]]s, and methods based on [[statistics]], [[operations research]], and [[economics]].{{efn|name="Tools of AI"}} AI also draws upon [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]] and other fields.<ref name="AI influences">{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=§1.2}}.</ref>

== Goals ==
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.{{efn|name="Problems of AI"|This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021}}, {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004}}, {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998}} and {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998}}}}

=== Reasoning, problem-solving ===
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.<ref>
Problem solving, puzzle solving, game playing and deduction:

* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 3–5}}
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 6}} ([[constraint satisfaction]])
* {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|loc=chpt. 2, 3, 7, 9}}
* {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|loc=chpt. 3, 4, 6, 8}}
* {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 7–12}}
</ref> By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with [[uncertainty|uncertain]] or incomplete information, employing concepts from [[probability]] and [[economics]].<ref>
Uncertain reasoning:
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 12–18}}
* {{Harvtxt|Poole|Mackworth|Goebel|1998|pp=345–395}}
* {{Harvtxt|Luger|Stubblefield|2004|pp=333–381}}
* {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1998|loc=chpt. 7–12}}
</ref>

Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.<ref name="Intractability">
[[Intractably|Intractability and efficiency]] and the [[combinatorial explosion]]:

* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=21}}

=== Knowledge representation ===

A [[knowledge base]] is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program.

</ref> and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).<ref name="Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning"/> There is also the difficulty of [[knowledge acquisition]], the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.{{efn|It is among the reasons that [[expert system]]s proved to be inefficient for capturing knowledge.{{sfnp|Newquist|1994|p=296}}{{sfnp|Crevier|1993|pp=204–208}}}}

=== Planning and decision making ===

An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A [[rational agent]] has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.{{efn|
"Rational agent" is general term used in [[economics]], [[philosophy]] and theoretical artificial intelligence. It can refer to anything that directs its behavior to accomplish goals, such as a person, an animal, a corporation, a nation, or, in the case of AI, a computer program.
}}{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=528}} In [[automated planning and scheduling|automated planning]], the agent has a specific goal.<ref>
[[Automated planning and scheduling|Automated planning]]:

* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 11}}.
</ref> In [[automated decision making]], the agent has preferences – there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the "[[utility (economics)|utility]]") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the "[[expected utility]]": the [[utility]] of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.<ref>
[[Automated decision making]], [[Decision theory]]:

* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=chpt. 16–18}}.
</ref>

In [[Automated planning and scheduling#classical planning|classical planning]], the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.<ref>
[[Automated planning and scheduling#classical planning|Classical planning]]:

* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 11.2}}.
</ref> In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is "unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.<ref>
Sensorless or "conformant" planning, contingent planning, replanning (a.k.a online planning):

* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 11.5}}.
</ref>

In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with [[inverse reinforcement learning]]) or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.<ref>
Uncertain preferences:
*{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 16.7}}
[[Inverse reinforcement learning]]:
*{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 22.6}}
</ref> [[Information value theory]] can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.<ref>
[[Information value theory]]:

* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Section 16.6}}.
</ref> The space of possible future actions and situations is typically [[intractable problem|intractably]] large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain what the outcome will be.

A [[Markov decision process]] has a [[Finite-state machine|transition model]] that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a [[reward function]] that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A [[Reinforcement learning#Policy|policy]] associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g. by [[policy iteration|iteration]]), be [[heuristic]], or it can be learned.<ref>
[[Markov decision process]]:

[[Game theory]] describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.<ref>

</ref>

Early work, based on [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[generative grammar]] and [[semantic network]]s, had difficulty with [[word-sense disambiguation]]{{efn|See {{section link|AI winter|Machine translation and the ALPAC report of 1966
}}}} unless restricted to small domains called "[[blocks world|micro-worlds]]" (due to the common sense knowledge problem<ref name="Breadth of commonsense knowledge" />). [[Margaret Masterman]] believed that it was meaning, and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that [[thesauri]] and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.

Modern [[deep learning]] techniques for NLP include [[word embedding]] (representing words, typically as [[Vector space|vectors]] encoding their meaning),{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=856–858}} [[transformer (machine learning model)|transformer]]s (a deep learning architecture using an [[Attention (machine learning)|attention]] mechanism),{{sfnp|Dickson|2022}} and others.<ref>Modern statistical and [[deep learning]] approaches to [[Natural language processing|NLP]]:

=== Perception ===<!-- This is linked to in the introduction -->

[[Machine perception]] is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active [[lidar]], sonar, radar, and [[tactile sensor]]s) to deduce aspects of the world. [[Computer vision]] is the ability to analyze visual input.<ref>

=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===
The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g. "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g. "if diamond then pick up"), on the other hand. [[Classifier (mathematics)|Classifiers]]<ref name="Statistical classifiers">

Each pattern (also called an "[[random variate|observation]]") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a [[data set]]. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.<ref name="Supervised learning"/>

There are many kinds of classifiers in use. The [[decision tree]] is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.<ref>

=== Artificial neural networks ===
[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|right|thumb|A neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of [[neuron]]s in the [[human brain]].]]

An [[Artificial neural network]] is based on a collection of nodes also known as [[artificial neurons]], which loosely model the [[neurons]] in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns, once trained it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the [[Weighting|weight]] crosses it’s specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a [[Deep learning|deep neural network]] if it has at least 2 hidden layers.<ref name="Neural networks">
Neural networks:
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=Chpt. 21}},

Learning algorithms for neural networks use [[local search (optimization)|local search]] to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the [[backpropagation]] algorithm.<ref name="Backpropagation">

uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.

Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including [[computer vision]], [[speech recognition]], [[natural language processing]], [[image classification]]{{sfnp|Ciresan|Meier|Schmidhuber|2012}}
and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=751}}
The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s){{efn|
Some form of deep neural networks (without a specific learning algorithm) were described by:
[[Alan Turing]] (1948);{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=785}}
[[Frank Rosenblatt]](1957);{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=785}}
[[Karl Steinbuch]] and [[Roger David Joseph]] (1961).{{sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=§5}}
Deep or recurrent networks that learned (or used gradient descent) were developed by:
[[Ernst Ising]] and [[Wilhelm Lenz]] (1925);{{sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=§6}}
[[Oliver Selfridge]] (1959);{{sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=§5}}

[[John Joseph Hopfield]] (1982).{{sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=§7}}
Backpropagation was independently discovered by:
[[Henry J. Kelley]] (1960);{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=785}}
[[Arthur E. Bryson]] (1962);{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=785}}

[[Paul Werbos]] (1974).{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=785}}
In fact, backpropagation and gradient descent are straight forward applications of [[Gottfried Leibniz]]' [[chain rule]] in calculus (1676),{{sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=§2}} and is essentially identical (for one layer) to the [[method of least squares]], developed independently by [[Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1795) and [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] (1805).{{sfnp|Schmidhuber|2022|loc=§3}} There are probably many others, yet to be discovered by historians of science.

===GPT===
[[Generative pre-trained transformer|Generative pre-trained transformers]] (GPT) are [[Large language model|large language models]] that are based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences ([[natural language processing]]). Text-based GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text which can be from the internet. The pre-training consists in predicting the next [[Lexical analysis|token]] (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pre-training, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world, and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful and harmless, usually with a technique called [[reinforcement learning from human feedback]] (RLHF). Current GPT models are still prone to generating falsehoods called "[[Hallucination (artificial intelligence)|hallucinations]]", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data.

In the early 2020s, [[generative AI]] gained widespread prominence. [[ChatGPT]], based on [[GPT-3]], and other [[large language model]]s, were tried by 14% of Americans adults. The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based [[Text-to-image model|text-to-image]] generators such as [[Midjourney]], [[DALL-E]], and [[Stable Diffusion]] sparked a trend of [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of [[Pope Francis]] wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of [[Donald Trump]], and a hoax of an attack on the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], as well as the usage in professional creative arts.

=== Industry Specific Tasks ===
{{citation needed section|date=January 2024}}
There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had incorporated "AI" in some offerings or processes. A few examples are [[energy storage]], medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, [[foreign policy]], or supply chain management.

In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.

Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for "classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.

==Ethics==
AI, like any powerful technology, has potential benefits and potential risks. AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: [[Demis Hassabis]] of [[DeepMind|Deep Mind]] hopes to "solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else".{{sfnp|Simonite|2016}} However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=987}}

Anyone looking to use machine learning as part of real-world, in-production systems needs to factor ethics into their AI training processes and strive to avoid bias. This is especially true when using AI algorithms that are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.{{sfnp|Laskowski|2023}}

=== Risks and harm ===
==== Privacy and copyright ====
{{Further|Information privacy|Artificial intelligence and copyright}}

Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about [[privacy]], [[surveillance]] and [[copyright]].

<!-- PRIVACY PROBLEM -->
Technology companies collect a wide range of data from their users, including online activity, geolocation data, video and audio.{{sfnp|GAO|2022}}
For example, in order to build [[speech recognition]] algorithms, [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] have recorded millions of private conversations and allowed [[temporary worker|temps]] to listen to and transcribe some of them.{{sfnp|Valinsky|2019}}
Opinions about this widespread [[surveillance]] range from those who see it as a [[necessary evil]] to those for whom it is clearly [[unethical]] and a violation of the [[right to privacy]].{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=991}}

<!-- PRIVACY SOLUTIONS -->
AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as [[data aggregation]], [[de-identification]] and [[differential privacy]].{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=991–992}} Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as [[Cynthia Dwork]], began to view privacy in terms of [[fairness (machine learning)|fairness]]. [[Brian Christian]] wrote that experts have pivoted "from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.".{{sfnp|Christian|2020|p=63}} 

<!-- COPYRIGHT AND GENERATIVE AI -->
Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under a rationale of "[[fair use]]". Also website owners who do not wish to have their copyrighted content be AI indexed or ‘scraped’ can add code to their site, as you would, if you did not want your website to be indexed by a search engine which is currently available to certain services such as [[OpenAI]]. Experts disagree about how well, and under what circumstances, this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include "the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work" and "the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work".{{sfnp|Vincent|2022}} In 2023, leading authors (including [[John Grisham]] and [[Jonathan Franzen]]) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.{{sfnp|Reisner|2023}}{{sfnp|Alter|Harris|2023}}

==== Misinformation ====
{{See also|YouTube#Moderation and offensive content}}

[[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and others use [[recommender system]]s to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of [[mathematical optimization|maximizing]] user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose [[misinformation]], [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]], and extreme [[partisan (politics)|partisan]] content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into [[filter bubbles]] where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.{{sfnp|Nicas|2018}} This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.<ref>{{cite web
| title = Trust and Distrust in America
| date=22 July 2019 | url=https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america/ }}</ref> The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem.

In 2022, [[generative AI]] began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.{{sfnp|Williams|2023}} AI pioneer [[Geoffrey Hinton]] expressed concern about AI enabling "authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates" on a large scale, among other risks.{{sfnp|Taylor|Hern|2023}}

====Algorithmic bias and fairness====
{{Main|Algorithmic bias|Fairness (machine learning)}}

Machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data.{{sfnp|Rose|2023}}
The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.{{sfnp|CNA|2019}}
Bias can be introduced by the way [[training data]] is selected and by the way a model is deployed.{{sfnp|Goffrey|2008|p=17}}{{sfnp|Rose|2023}} If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously [[harm]] people (as it can in [[health equity|medicine]], [[credit rating|finance]], [[recruitment]], [[public housing|housing]] or [[policing]]) then the algorithm may cause [[discrimination]].<ref>{{Harvtxt|Berdahl|Baker|Mann|Osoba|2023}}; {{Harvtxt|Goffrey|2008|p=17}}; {{Harvtxt|Rose|2023}}; {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}}</ref>
[[Fairness (machine learning)|Fairness]] in machine learning is the study of how to prevent the harm caused by algorithmic bias. It has become serious area of academic study within AI. Researchers have discovered it is not always possible to define "fairness" in a way that satisfies all stakeholders.<ref>
[[Algorithmic bias]] and [[Fairness (machine learning)]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|loc=section 27.3.3}}
* {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|loc=Fairness}}
</ref>

On June 28, 2015, [[Google Photos]]'s new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as "gorillas" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,{{sfnp|Christian|2020|p=25}} a problem called "sample size disparity".{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}} Google "fixed" this problem by preventing the system from labelling ''anything'' as a "gorilla". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.{{sfnp|Grant|Hill|2023}}

[[COMPAS (software)|COMPAS]] is a commercial program widely used by [[U.S. court]]s to assess the likelihood of a [[defendant]] becoming a [[recidivist]].
In 2016, [[Julia Angwin]] at [[ProPublica]] discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.{{sfnp|Larson|Angwin|2016}} In 2017, several researchers{{efn|Including [[Jon Kleinberg]] ([[Cornell]]), Sendhil Mullainathan ([[University of Chicago]]), Cynthia Chouldechova ([[Carnegie Mellon]]) and Sam Corbett-Davis ([[Stanford]]){{sfnp|Christian|2020|p=67–70}}}} showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|pp=67–70}}; {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=993–994}}</ref>

A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as "race" or "gender"). The feature will correlate with other features (like "address", "shopping history" or "first name"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on "race" or "gender".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}}; {{Harvtxt|Lipartito|2011|p=36}}; {{Harvtxt|Goodman|Flaxman|2017|p=6}}; {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|pp=39–40, 65}}</ref>
Moritz Hardt said "the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work."<ref>Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|p=65}}.</ref>

Criticism of COMPAS highlighted a deeper problem with the misuse of AI. Machine learning models are designed to make "predictions" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. Unfortunately, if an application then uses these predictions as ''recommendations'', some of these "recommendations" will likely be racist.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=994}}; {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|pp=40, 80–81}}</ref> Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be ''better'' than the past. It is necessarily descriptive and not proscriptive.{{efn|Moritz Hardt (a director at the [[Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems]]) argues that machine learning "is fundamentally the wrong tool for a lot of domains, where you're trying to design interventions and mechanisms that change the world."<ref>Quoted in {{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|p=80}}</ref>}}

Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=995}}

At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022) the [[Association for Computing Machinery]], in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings recommending that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.{{sfnp|Dockrill|2022}}

==== Lack of transparency ====
{{See also|Explainable AI|Algorithmic transparency|Right to explanation}}
[[File:HiPhi Z, IAA Summit 2023, Munich (P1120237).jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|[[Lidar]] testing vehicle for autonomous driving]]
Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.{{sfnp|Sample|2017}} Particularly with [[deep neural networks]], in which there are a large amount of non-[[linear]] relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34940/black-box-ai | title=Black Box AI | date=16 June 2023 }}</ref>

There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a [[ruler]] as "cancerous", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.{{sfnp|Christian|2020|p=110}} Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at "low risk" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.{{sfnp|Christian|2020|pp=88-91}}

People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a [[Right to explanation|right to an explanation]]. Doctors, for example, are required to clearly and completely explain the reasoning behind any decision they make.{{Clarify|date=November 2023|reason=Everywhere in the world? If not so, precise in which countries or according to which law. (also, not sure the reference Christian 2020 p. 83 contains the given information)}}<ref>{{Harvtxt|Christian|2020|p=83}}; {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=997}}</ref> Early drafts of the European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]] in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.{{efn|When the law was passed in 2018, it still contained a form of this provision.}} Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.{{sfnp|Christian|2020|p=91}}

[[DARPA]] established the [[Explainable Artificial Intelligence|XAI]] ("Explainable Artificial Intelligence") program in 2014 to try and solve these problems.{{sfnp|Christian|2020|p=83}}

There are several potential solutions to the transparency problem. SHAP helps visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.{{sfnp|Verma|2021}} LIME can locally approximate a model with a simpler, interpretable model.{{sfnp|Rothman|2020}} [[Multitask learning]] provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.{{sfnp|Christian|2020|p=105-108}} [[Deconvolution]], [[DeepDream]] and other [[generative AI|generative]] methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network have learned and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.{{sfnp|Christian|2020|pp=108-112}}

==== Conflict, surveillance and weaponized AI ====
{{Main|Lethal autonomous weapon|Artificial intelligence arms race|AI safety}}

A [[lethal autonomous weapon]] is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.{{efn|This is the [[United Nations]]' definition, and includes things like [[land mines]] as well.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=989}}}} By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.<ref>{{harvtxt|Robitzski|2018}}; {{harvtxt|Sainato|2015}}</ref> These weapons are considered especially dangerous for several reasons: if they [[murder|kill an innocent person]] it is not clear who should be held [[accountability|accountable]], it is unlikely they will reliably choose targets, and, if produced at scale, they are potentially [[weapons of mass destruction]].{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=987-990}} In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the [[United Nations]]' [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]], however the [[United States]] and others disagreed.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=988}}

AI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for [[authoritarian]] governments: smart [[spyware]], [[Facial recognition system|face recognition]] and [[Speaker recognition|voice recognition]] allow widespread [[surveillance]]; such surveillance allows [[machine learning]] to [[classifier (machine learning)|classify]] potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; [[recommender system|recommendation systems]] can precisely target [[propaganda]] and [[misinformation]] for maximum effect; [[deepfakes]] and [[generative AI]] aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make authoritarian [[technocracy|centralized decision making]] more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as [[market (economics)|market]]s.{{sfnp|Harari|2018}}

AI [[facial recognition system]]s are used for [[mass surveillance]], notably in China.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Buckley |first1=Chris |last2=Mozur |first2=Paul |date=22 May 2019 |title=How China Uses High-Tech Surveillance to Subdue Minorities |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=3 May 2019 |title=Security lapse exposed a Chinese smart city surveillance system |url=https://social.techcrunch.com/2019/05/03/china-smart-city-exposed/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307203740/https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=3_cc-session_c8562b93-9863-4915-8523-6c7b930a3efc |archive-date=7 March 2021 |access-date=14 September 2020}}</ref> In 2019, [[Bangalore|Bengaluru, India]] deployed AI-managed traffic signals.

==== Technological unemployment ====
{{Main|Workplace impact of artificial intelligence|Technological unemployment}}
From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence there have been arguments, for example those put forward by [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Tarnoff |first=Ben |date=4 August 2023 |title=Lessons from Eliza |pages=34–9 |work=[[The Guardian Weekly]]}}</ref>

Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.<ref name="auto1">E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2022) [https://academic.oup.com/ilj/article/51/3/511/6321008 51(3) Industrial Law Journal 511–559] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230527163045/https://academic.oup.com/ilj/article/51/3/511/6321008 |date=27 May 2023 }}</ref>

<!-- TOPIC: ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF UNEMPLOYMENT -->
In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that "we're in uncharted territory" with AI.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ford|Colvin|2015}};{{Harvtxt|McGaughey|2022}}</ref> A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term [[unemployment]], but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if [[productivity]] gains are [[Redistribution of income and wealth|redistributed]].{{sfnp|IGM Chicago|2017}} Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and [[Carl Benedikt Frey]] estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at "high risk" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as "high risk".{{efn|See table 4; 9% is both the OECD average and the US average.{{sfnp|Arntz|Gregory|Zierahn|2016|p=33}}}}<ref>{{Harvtxt|Lohr|2017}}; {{Harvtxt|Frey|Osborne|2017}}; {{Harvtxt|Arntz|Gregory|Zierahn|2016|p=33}}</ref> The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.<ref name="auto1"/>

<!-- TOPIC: WHICH JOBS ARE AT RISK? -->
Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; ''[[The Economist]]'' stated in 2015 that "the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution" is "worth taking seriously".{{sfnp|Morgenstern|2015}} Jobs at extreme risk range from [[paralegal]]s to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Mahdawi|2017}}; {{Harvtxt|Thompson|2014}}</ref>

In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illlustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zhou |first=Viola |date=2023-04-11 |title=AI is already taking video game illustrators' jobs in China |url=https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-china-video-game-layoffs/ |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=Rest of World |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Carter |first=Justin |date=2023-04-11 |title=China's game art industry reportedly decimated by growing AI use |url=https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/china-s-game-art-industry-reportedly-decimated-ai-art-use |access-date=2023-08-17 |website=Game Developer |language=en}}</ref>

==== Existential risk ====
{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}

It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] stated, "[[Global catastrophic risk|spell the end of the human race]]".{{sfnp|Cellan-Jones|2014}} This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like "self-awareness" (or "sentience" or "consciousness") and becomes a malevolent character.{{efn|Sometimes called a "[[robopocalypse]]".{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=1001}}}} These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.

First, AI does not require human-like "sentience" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] argued that if one gives ''almost any'' goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip factory manager]]).{{sfnp|Bostrom|2014}} [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that "you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."{{sfnp|Russell|2019}} In order to be safe for humanity, a [[superintelligence]] would have to be genuinely [[AI alignment|aligned]] with humanity's morality and values so that it is "fundamentally on our side".<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2014}}; {{Harvtxt|Müller|Bostrom|2014}}; {{Harvtxt|Bostrom|2015}}.</ref>

Second, [[Yuval Noah Harari]] argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like [[ideology|ideologies]], [[law]], [[government]], [[money]] and the [[economy]] are made of [[language]]; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of [[misinformation]] suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.{{sfnp|Harari|2023}}

The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.{{sfnp|Müller|Bostrom|2014}} Personalities such as [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concern about existential risk from AI.<ref>
Leaders' concerns about the existential risks of AI around 2015:
*{{harvtxt|Rawlinson|2015}}
*{{Harvtxt|Holley|2015}}
*{{Harvtxt|Gibbs|2014}}
*{{harvtxt|Sainato|2015}}
</ref>

In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.<ref>
Arguments that AI is not an imminent risk:
*{{Harvtxt|Brooks|2014}}
*{{Harvtxt|Geist |2015}}
*{{Harvtxt|Madrigal|2015}}
*{{Harvtxt|Lee|2014}}
</ref> However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.{{sfnp|Christian|2020|pp=67, 73}}

AI pioneers including [[Fei-Fei Li]], [[Geoffrey Hinton]], [[Yoshua Bengio]], [[Cynthia Breazeal]], [[Rana el Kaliouby]], [[Demis Hassabis]], [[Joy Buolamwini]], and [[Sam Altman]] have expressed concerns about the risks of AI. In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that "Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war".{{sfnp|Valance|2023}}

Other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer [[Juergen Schmidhuber]] did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making "human lives longer and healthier and easier."<ref name="guardian2023">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/07/rise-of-artificial-intelligence-is-inevitable-but-should-not-be-feared-father-of-ai-says|title=Rise of artificial intelligence is inevitable but should not be feared, 'father of AI' says|last1=Taylor|first1=Josh|date=7 May 2023|work=The Guardian|access-date=26 May 2023|language=en}}</ref> While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, "they can also be used against the bad actors."<ref name="foxnews2023">{{cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/tech/father-ai-jurgen-schmidhuber-says-tech-fears-misplaced-cannot-stop|title='Father of AI' says tech fears misplaced: 'You cannot stop it'|last1=Colton|first1=Emma|date=7 May 2023|work=Fox News|access-date=26 May 2023|language=en}}</ref><ref name="forbes2023">{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hessiejones/2023/05/23/juergen-schmidhuber-renowned-father-of-modern-ai-says-his-lifes-work-wont-lead-to-dystopia/|title=Juergen Schmidhuber, Renowned 'Father Of Modern AI,' Says His Life's Work Won't Lead To Dystopia|last1=Jones|first1=Hessie|date=23 May 2023|work=Forbes|access-date=26 May 2023|language=en}}</ref> [[Andrew Ng]] also argued that "it’s a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests."<ref name="andrewng2023">{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/2dc07f9e-d2a9-4d98-b746-b051f9352be3|title=Andrew Ng: 'Do we think the world is better off with more or less intelligence?'|last1=McMorrow|first1=Ryan |date=19 Dec 2023|work=Financial Times|access-date=30 Dec 2023|language=en}}</ref> [[Yann LeCun]] "scoffs at his peers’ dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction."<ref name="lecun2023">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-meta-yann-lecun-interview/|title=How Not to Be Stupid About AI, With Yann LeCun|last1=Levy|first1=Steven |date=22 Dec 2023|magazine=Wired|access-date=30 Dec 2023|language=en}}</ref>

==== Limiting AI ====
Possible options for limiting AI include: using Embedded Ethics or Constitutional AI where companies or governments can add a policy, restricting high levels of compute power in training, restricting the ability to rewrite its own code base, restrict certain AI techniques but not in the training phase, open-source (transparency) vs proprietary (could be more restricted), backup model with redundancy, restricting security, privacy and copyright, restricting or controlling the memory, real-time monitoring, risk analysis, emergency shut-off, rigorous simulation and testing, model certification, assess known vulnerabilities, restrict the training material, restrict access to the internet, issue terms of use.

=== Ethical machines and alignment ===

Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]], who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.{{sfnp|Yudkowsky|2008}}

Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.{{sfnp|Anderson|Anderson|2011}}
The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,{{sfnp|Anderson|Anderson|2011}}
and was founded at an [[AAAI]] symposium in 2005.{{sfnp|AAAI|2014}}

Other approaches include [[Wendell Wallach]]'s "artificial moral agents"{{sfnp|Wallach|2010}}
and [[Stuart J. Russell]]'s [[Human Compatible#Russell's three principles|three principles]] for developing provably beneficial machines.{{sfnp|Russell|2019|p=173}}

Artificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values – developed by the [[Alan Turing Institute]] tests projects in four main areas:<ref>{{cite web |date=2019 |title=Understanding artificial intelligence ethics and safety |author=Alan Turing Institute|url=https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2019-06/understanding_artificial_intelligence_ethics_and_safety.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2023 |title=AI Ethics and Governance in Practice|author=Alan Turing Institute|url=https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-12/aieg-ati-ai-ethics-an-intro_1.pdf}}</ref>

The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to [[Alan Turing]]'s [[theory of computation]], which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate both mathematical deduction and formal reasoning, which is known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]].{{sfnp|Berlinski|2000}} This, along with concurrent discoveries in [[cybernetics]] and [[information theory]], led researchers to consider the possibility of building an "electronic brain".{{efn|"Electronic brain" was the term used by the press around this time.<ref>{{cite web|title = Google books ngram| url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=electronic+brain&year_start=1930&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3}}</ref>}}<ref>

Alan Turing was thinking about machine intelligence at least as early as 1941, when he circulated a paper on machine intelligence which could be the earliest paper in the field of AI – though it is now lost.<ref name="turing">{{Cite book |title=The Essential Turing: the ideas that gave birth to the computer age |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-825079-7 |editor-last=Copeland |editor-first=J. |location=Oxford, England |language=en}}</ref> The first available paper generally recognized as "AI" was [[Warren McCullouch|McCullouch]] and [[Walter Pitts|Pitts]] design for [[Turing-complete]] "artificial neurons" in 1943 – the first mathematical model of a neural network.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=17}} The paper was influenced by Turing's earlier paper '[[Turing's proof|On Computable Numbers]]' from 1936 using similar two-state boolean 'neurons', but was the first to apply it to neuronal function.<ref name="turing" />

The term 'Machine Intelligence' was used by Alan Turing during his life which was later often referred to as 'Artificial Intelligence' after his death in 1954. In 1950 Turing published the best known of his papers '[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]', the paper introduced his concept of what is now known as the [[Turing test]] to the general public. Then followed three radio broadcasts on AI by Turing, the lectures: 'Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory’, ‘Can Digital Computers Think’? and the panel discussion ‘Can Automatic Calculating Machines be Said to Think’. By 1956 computer intelligence had been actively pursued for more than a decade in Britain; the earliest AI programmes were written there in 1951–1952.<ref name="turing" />

McCarthy defines intelligence as "the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world."{{sfnp|McCarthy|1999}} Another AI founder, [[Marvin Minsky]] similarly defines it as "the ability to solve hard problems".{{sfnp|Minsky|1986}} These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the "intelligence" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.

Another definition has been adopted by Google,<ref>{{Cite web |title=What Is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? |url=https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230731114802/https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence |archive-date=31 July 2023 |access-date=16 October 2023 |website=[[Google Cloud Platform]]}}</ref> a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.

=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===

No established unifying theory or [[paradigm]] has guided AI research for most of its history.{{efn
|[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] wrote in 1983: "Simply put, there is wide disagreement in the field about what AI is all about."{{sfnp|Nilsson|1983|p=10}}}} The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term "artificial intelligence" to mean "machine learning with neural networks"). This approach is mostly [[sub-symbolic]], [[soft computing|soft]] and [[artificial general intelligence|narrow]] (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.

====Symbolic AI and its limits====
Symbolic AI (or "[[GOFAI]]"){{sfnp|Haugeland|1985|pp=112–117}} simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at "intelligent" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the [[physical symbol systems hypothesis]]: "A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."<ref name="Physical symbol system hypothesis">
Physical symbol system hypothesis:
* {{Harvtxt|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}
Historical significance:
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|p=153}}
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=19}}
</ref>

However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. [[Moravec's paradox]] is the discovery that high-level "intelligent" tasks were easy for AI, but low level "instinctive" tasks were extremely difficult.<ref>
[[Moravec's paradox]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988|pp=15–16}}
* {{Harvtxt|Minsky|1986|p=29}}
* {{Harvtxt|Pinker|2007|pp=190–91}}
</ref> Philosopher [[Hubert Dreyfus]] had [[Dreyfus' critique of AI|argued]] since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a "feel" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.<ref name="Dreyfus' critique">
[[Dreyfus' critique of AI]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Dreyfus|1972}}
* {{Harvtxt |Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}
Historical significance and philosophical implications:
* {{Harvtxt |Crevier|1993|pp=120–132}}
* {{Harvtxt |McCorduck|2004|pp=211–239}}
* {{Harvtxt |Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=981–982}}
* {{Harvtxt |Fearn|2007|loc=Chpt. 3}}
</ref> Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.{{efn|
Daniel Crevier wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."{{sfnp|Crevier|1993|p=125}}
}}<ref name="Psychological evidence of sub-symbolic reasoning"/>

The issue is not resolved: [[sub-symbolic]] reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as [[algorithmic bias]]. Critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]] argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,{{sfnp|Langley|2011}}{{sfnp|Katz|2012}} in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from [[explainable AI]]: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of [[Neuro-symbolic AI|neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence]] attempts to bridge the two approaches.

==== Neat vs. scruffy ====
{{Main|Neats and scruffies}}
"Neats" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as [[logic]], [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], or [[neural networks]]). "Scruffies" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,<ref name="Neats vs. scruffies">
[[Neats vs. scruffies]], the historic debate:
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=421–424, 486–489}}
* {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|p=168}}
* {{Harvtxt|Nilsson|1983|pp=10–11}}
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=24}}
A classic example of the "scruffy" approach to intelligence:
* {{Harvtxt|Minsky|1986}}
A modern example of neat AI and its aspirations in the 21st century:
* {{Harvtxt|Domingos|2015}}
</ref> but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both.

==== Soft vs. hard computing ====
{{Main|Soft computing}}
Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]] for many important problems.<ref name="Intractability"/> Soft computing is a set of techniques, including [[genetic algorithms]], [[fuzzy logic]] and [[neural networks]], that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.

==== Narrow vs. general AI ====
{{Main|Artificial general intelligence}}
AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and [[superintelligence]] directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible ([[Weak artificial intelligence|narrow AI]]) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.{{sfnp|Pennachin|Goertzel|2007}}{{sfnp|Roberts|2016}} General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.

=== Machine consciousness, sentience and mind ===
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence|Artificial consciousness}}
The [[philosophy of mind]] does not know whether a machine can have a [[mind]], [[consciousness]] and [[philosophy of mind|mental states]], in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] add that "[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=986}} However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in [[artificial intelligence in fiction]].

==== Consciousness ====
{{Main|Hard problem of consciousness|Theory of mind}}
[[David Chalmers]] identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the "hard" and "easy" problems of consciousness.{{sfnp|Chalmers|1995}} The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this ''feels'' or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). Human [[Information processing (psychology)|information processing]] is easy to explain, however, human [[subjective experience]] is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to ''know what red looks like''.{{sfnp|Dennett|1991}}

==== Computationalism and functionalism ====
{{Main|Computational theory of mind|Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Chinese room}}
Computationalism is the position in the [[philosophy of mind]] that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the [[mind–body problem]]. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]].{{sfnp|Horst|2005}}

Philosopher [[John Searle]] characterized this position as "[[Strong AI hypothesis|strong AI]]": "The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."{{efn|name="Searle's strong AI"|
Searle presented this definition of "Strong AI" in 1999.{{sfnp|Searle|1999}} Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."{{sfnp|Searle|1980|p=1}} Strong AI is defined similarly by [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]]: "Stong AI – the assertion that machines that do so are ''actually'' thinking (as opposed to ''simulating'' thinking)."{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=9817}}
}} Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.<ref name="Chinese room">

* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=443–445}}
* {{Harvtxt|Crevier|1993|pp=269–271}}
</ref>

==== Robot rights ====
{{Main|Robot rights}}
If a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have [[sentience]] (the ability to feel), and if so it could also ''suffer''; it has been argued that this could entitle it to certain rights.<ref>
[[Robot rights]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=1000–1001}}
* {{Harvtxt|BBC|2006}}
* {{Harvtxt|Maschafilm|2010}} (the film [[Plug & Pray]])
</ref> Any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with [[animal rights]] and human rights.{{sfnp|Evans|2015}} This issue has been considered in [[artificial intelligence in fiction|fiction]] for centuries,{{sfnp|McCorduck|2004|pp=19–25}} and is now being considered by, for example, California's [[Institute for the Future]]; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.{{sfnp|Henderson|2007}}

== Future ==
=== Superintelligence and the singularity ===

<!-- SUPERINTELLIGENCE -->
A [[superintelligence]] is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.{{sfnp|Roberts|2016}}

<!-- SINGULARITY -->
If research into [[artificial general intelligence]] produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what [[I. J. Good]] called an "[[intelligence explosion]]" and [[Vernor Vinge]] called a "[[Technological singularity|singularity]]".<ref name = "Singularity">
The [[Intelligence explosion]] and [[technological singularity]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|pp=1004–1005}}
* {{Harvtxt|Omohundro|2008}}
* {{Harvtxt|Kurzweil|2005}}
[[I. J. Good]]'s "intelligence explosion"
* {{Harvtxt|Good|1965}}
[[Vernor Vinge]]'s "singularity"
* {{Harvtxt|Vinge|1993}}
</ref>

<!-- ANTI-SINGULARITIANISM -->
However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an [[S-shaped curve]], slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.{{sfnp|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=1005}}

=== Transhumanism ===
<!-- TRANSHUMANISM -->
Robot designer [[Hans Moravec]], cyberneticist [[Kevin Warwick]], and inventor [[Ray Kurzweil]] have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into [[cyborg]]s that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in [[Aldous Huxley]] and [[Robert Ettinger]].<ref>
[[Transhumanism]]:
* {{Harvtxt|Moravec|1988}}
* {{Harvtxt|Kurzweil|2005}}
* {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2021|p=1005}}
</ref>

<!-- EVOLUTION / HUMAN REPLACEMENT -->
[[Edward Fredkin]] argues that "artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution", an idea first proposed by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s "[[Darwin among the Machines]]" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by [[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]] in his book of the same name in 1998.<ref>

== In fiction ==
{{Main|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}
[[File:Capek play.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The word "robot" itself was coined by [[Karel Čapek]] in his 1921 play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the title standing for "Rossum's Universal Robots".]]

Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,<ref name="AI in myth">
AI in myth:
* {{Harvtxt|McCorduck|2004|pp=4–5}}
</ref> and have been a persistent theme in [[science fiction]].{{sfnp|McCorduck|2004|pp=340–400}}

A common [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in these works began with [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as [[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|Arthur C. Clarke's]] and [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|Stanley Kubrick's]] ''2001: A Space Odyssey'' (both 1968), with [[HAL 9000]], the murderous computer in charge of the ''[[Discovery One]]'' spaceship, as well as ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Matrix]]'' (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951) and Bishop from ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.{{sfnp|Buttazzo|2001}}

[[Isaac Asimov]] introduced the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] in many books and stories, most notably the "Multivac" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;{{sfnp|Anderson|2008}} while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.{{sfnp|McCauley|2007}}

Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have [[sentience|the ability to feel]], and thus to suffer. This appears in [[Karel Čapek]]'s ''[[R.U.R.]]'', the films ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]'', as well as the novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', by [[Philip K. Dick]]. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.{{sfnp|Galvan|1997}}

[[George Dyson (science historian)|George Dyson]], historian of computing, writes (in what might be called "Dyson's Law") that "Any system simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to behave intelligently will be too complicated to understand." (p.&nbsp;197.) Computer scientist [[Alex Pentland]] writes: "Current [[machine learning|AI machine-learning]] [[algorithm]]s are, at their core, dead simple stupid.

"This murder mystery competition has revealed that although NLP ([[natural-language processing]]) models are capable of incredible feats, their abilities are very much limited by the amount of [[context (linguistics)|context]] they receive. This [...] could cause [difficulties] for researchers who hope to use them to do things such as analyze [[ancient language]]s.

"If by '[[deepfakes]]' we mean realistic videos produced using artificial intelligence that actually deceive people, then they barely exist. The fakes aren't deep, and the deeps aren't fake. [...] A.I.-generated videos are not, in general, operating in our media as counterfeited evidence. Their role better resembles that of [[cartoon]]s, especially smutty ones." (p.&nbsp;59.)

Marcus points out a so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence: an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]]. "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways. Our brain is so good at comprehending [[language]] that we do not usually notice." A prominent example is the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"): a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.
